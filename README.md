## Project Overview
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Difficulty Level**: Intermediate
- **Purpose**: To create a dynamic and responsive portfolio to highlight my projects, skills, and contact information.

## Features

- **About Page**: A timeline-based section detailing my experience, education, and skills with fade-in animations.
- **Projects Page**: A gallery of my projects with clickable cards that open modals for more details, including live demos and GitHub links.
- **Contact Page**: A contact form with validation, contact information, social links, and a resume download option.
